  abstract = {This paper is devoted to investigating the finite-time consensus problem for a multi-agent system in networks with undirected topology. A new class of global continuous time-invariant consensus protocols is constructed for each single-integrator agent dynamics with the aid of Lyapunov functions. In particular, it is shown that the settling time of the proposed new class of finite-time consensus protocols is upper bounded for arbitrary initial conditions. This makes it possible for network consensus problems that the convergence time is designed and estimated offline for a given undirected information flow and a group volume of agents. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented as a proof of concept.},
