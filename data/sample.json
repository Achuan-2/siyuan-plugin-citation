  {"id":"zuoRobustFixedTimeStabilization2022","abstract":"This article addresses the robust ﬁxed-time stabilization control problem for generic linear systems with both matched and mismatched disturbances. A new observer-based ﬁxed-time control technique is proposed to solve this robust stabilization problem, provided that the system matrix pair (A, B) is controllable. The ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system in the presence of mismatched disturbances is proven. An upper bound of the convergence time is provided, which is irrelevant to initial conditions. Finally, a simulation example is presented to show the efﬁciency of the proposed control design method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zuo","given":"Zongyu"},{"family":"Song","given":"Jiawei"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Bailing"},{"family":"Basin","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"zuoRobustFixedTimeStabilization2022","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.
